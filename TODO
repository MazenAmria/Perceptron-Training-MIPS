input_module:
  read the parameters from the user (learning rate, momentum, number of epochs, initial weight, initial threshold)
  read from the file:
    i,j,k (number of instances, number of features, number of classes) all are integers
    F0,F1,F2,...,ClassNo (read a line, first j numbers are floats insert them as row in the X matrix,
    last number is integer convert it using one_hot_encoding to a row in Y matrix)
    
file is CSV
